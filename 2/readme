Develop a contact management app version 1:
•	The main activity would start with no contact, but it has a button where the user could use to add a new contact
•	On clicking” Add Contact” button in the main activity, it goes to the second activity, where the user could add the contact information such as name, phone number, email, etc.
•	After entering a new contact, the user could click the submit button in the second activity, which the second activity will be closed, and the app goes back to the main activity
•	The main activity now should display the new contact information.
