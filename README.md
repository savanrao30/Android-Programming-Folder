1. Add a UI control on the screen of the second activity so that you can close the second activity and go back to the first activity (i.e., the main activity). In addition, on the main activity, display an iteration count that reflects the number of times the main activity has been displayed on the front ground.

2. Develop a contact management app version 1:
•	The main activity would start with no contact, but it has a button where the user could use to add a new contact
•	On clicking” Add Contact” button in the main activity, it goes to the second activity, where the user could add the contact information such as name, phone number, email, etc.
•	After entering a new contact, the user could click the submit button in the second activity, which the second activity will be closed, and the app goes back to the main activity
•	The main activity now should display the new contact information.
